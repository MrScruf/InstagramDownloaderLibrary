# InstgramDownloaderRemake

As instagram is shutting down its public API in 2020, the only viable option for getting its posts is via web-scraping. 
This project does exactly that. Predecessor of this project is https://github.com/MrScruf/Instagram-Downloader, but unlike that,
this project will solely be just a library for interactions with instagram web interface, getting image links, checking user
statuses (such as banned etc..), getting followers count, posts count etc..
